## Notes
Mobile optimization is essential for the site's success, as a significant percentage of users will access it from mobile devices. Test on real devices when possible, not just emulators. Pay special attention to the admin dashboard interfaces, which are typically designed for desktop first. Focus on a "mobile-first" approach for any new components being added.
