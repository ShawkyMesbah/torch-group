# Setup Basic Testing Framework

## Description
Implement essential testing for critical functionality to ensure the core features work properly in production.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Set up Jest for basic unit testing
- Configure a minimal test environment for API endpoints
- Create smoke tests for critical user flows
- Implement basic authentication tests
- Add form submission tests for key forms (contact, login)
- Set up simple end-to-end tests for critical paths
- Document testing approach for future expansion

## Priority
Medium

## Estimated Effort
3 days

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Verify .env Configuration
- Task 004: Implement Email Integration
- Task 009: Complete Dashboard UI Components

## Notes
Focus on implementing a minimal testing framework that covers the most critical functionality first. This should include basic tests for authentication, form submissions, and key API endpoints. A more comprehensive testing strategy can be developed in future iterations.
