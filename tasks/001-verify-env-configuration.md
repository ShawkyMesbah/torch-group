# Verify .env Configuration

## Description
Verify and update the .env file configuration, checking for placeholders or missing variables before production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Review the existing .env file for completeness
- Replace any placeholder API keys with actual production values
- Verify database connection strings are correctly configured
- Ensure all NextAuth secrets are properly set
- Confirm Resend email API key is valid
- Validate UploadThing configuration
- Check that all environment-specific variables are set for production
- Create a documented .env.example file for onboarding

## Priority
Critical

## Estimated Effort
3 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
This is a critical verification task before production deployment. The previous .env file may contain placeholders or development values that need to be updated for production use. Special attention should be paid to sensitive information like database credentials and API keys. Create a properly documented .env.example file (without real credentials) for future reference.
