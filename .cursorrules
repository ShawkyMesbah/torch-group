# Cursor Rules

> **Always review this file before starting, editing, or deploying any feature.**
> Also review `TASKMASTER.md` and `PRODUCTION_ENV_CHECKLIST.md` before any major project action.

## Instructions

- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections in the `Lessons` section.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[X]` Completed
  - `[ ]` Not started
  - `[P]` In progress
  - `[B]` Blocked
- Add a priority label to each task:
  - `[ðŸ”¥]` Critical/High
  - `[Medium]` Medium
  - `[Low]` Low
- Update the Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.
- **IMPORTANT:** Never overwrite existing .env filesâ€”always check if they exist and ask for confirmation before modifying.

## Lessons Learned (Key Takeaways)

- Use `bcryptjs` for cross-platform password hashing.
- Always use `@/generated/prisma` for consistent type resolution.
- Static rendering is incompatible with authenticated data.
- Next.js middleware may require runtime config to avoid Edge errors.
- Keep mobile styles in a dedicated file for clarity.
- Use consistent section padding and fluid typography for visual rhythm.
- Use type assertions and key props for enum lists in React.
- Use JSON files for simple config and fallback storage.
- Always check for .env file existence before writing.
- Use Suspense and dynamic imports for large dashboard components.
- Use toast notifications and loading states for async UI actions.
- Run `prisma generate` as admin on Windows to avoid permission errors.
- Use hardcoded admin credentials for dev mode if no DB is present.
- Use SWR or server-side caching for frequently accessed data.
