## Overview

TaskMaster AI is an AI-powered task management system integrated into our development workflow. It helps with:

- Breaking down complex features into manageable tasks
- Tracking progress of implementation
- Providing AI assistance during development
- Standardizing task documentation

## Prerequisites

To use TaskMaster AI, you need:

1. An Anthropic API key (Claude)
2. Cursor editor (recommended) or another editor with MCP support

## Setup

1. TaskMaster AI has been installed in the project with:
   ```
   npm install task-master-ai --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Configuration files are already set up:
   - `.cursor/mcp_config.json` - MCP server configuration
   - `.taskmasterconfig` - TaskMaster project configuration 
   - `tasks/` directory - Contains all project tasks

3. You need to add your personal Anthropic API key to the `.cursor/mcp_config.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "taskmaster-ai": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
         "env": {
           "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## How to Use

### Common Commands

You can interact with TaskMaster AI through your AI assistant by typing:

- **View tasks**: "What tasks do we have in the project?"
- **Get next task**: "What's the next task I should work on?"
- **Task details**: "Can you tell me more about task 001?"
- **Help with implementation**: "Help me implement task 001"
- **Create new task**: "Create a new task for implementing email notifications"
- **Parse requirements**: "Parse my requirements document at docs/requirements.md"

### Task Structure

Each task follows this standard format:

```markdown
# [Task Title]

## Description
[Brief description of the task]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

## Priority
[Low/Medium/High]

## Estimated Effort
[Time estimate]

## Dependencies
- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]

## Notes
[Additional information]
```

### Creating New Tasks

To create a new task manually:

1. Create a new file in the `tasks/` directory with the format `[number]-[task-name].md`
2. Follow the task structure format above
3. Ensure the task number is unique and sequential

Or ask TaskMaster AI to create it for you!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with TaskMaster AI:

1. Ensure your Anthropic API key is valid and has sufficient quota
2. Check that the MCP server is enabled in your editor
3. Verify that the `.taskmasterconfig` file has the correct settings
4. Try reinstalling the package: `npm install task-master-ai --legacy-peer-deps`

- Always check `.cursorrules` for current project status, blockers, and priorities before starting work.
- Review `PRODUCTION_ENV_CHECKLIST.md` before any deployment or environment change.
- Break down large or vague tasks into actionable sub-tasks.
- Use clear, concise acceptance criteria for every task.
- Mark task status and priority using the conventions in `.cursorrules`.
- Update task status as soon as progress is made.
- Document blockers and lessons learned in `.cursorrules`.
- Focus on content enhancement and minor maintenance over major feature development.
